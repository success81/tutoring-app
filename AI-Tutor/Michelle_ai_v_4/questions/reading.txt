@1. One day in Care-a-Lot, the Care Bears decided to hold a race to see whose cloud car was the fastest. Funshine Bear, who loved science, thought it would be a great opportunity to teach the other bears about physics. As the bears lined up their cloud cars at the starting line, Funshine explained, "Physics is the study of how things move and interact. In this race, we’ll be looking at speed, force, and something called momentum."
Cheer Bear raised her paw. "What’s momentum?" she asked. Funshine smiled and replied, "Momentum is the combination of how fast something is moving and how heavy it is. For example, a heavy car going fast has more momentum than a light car going slowly. The faster or heavier something is, the harder it is to stop!"
As the race began, the bears zoomed through the fluffy clouds. Grumpy Bear’s car was heavier than the others, so even though he started slower, his car built up more momentum as it went. Cheer Bear, whose car was lighter and faster at the start, quickly realized that her car slowed down whenever she hit a bump. Funshine Bear reminded them, "That’s because of friction! Friction is the force that happens when things rub against each other, like the clouds against your car. It slows things down."
At the end of the race, Funshine Bear used what happened to teach a final lesson. "See? Physics affects everything, even here in Care-a-Lot! Understanding speed, force, and friction helps us understand why things move the way they do." The Care Bears learned that physics wasn’t just something scientists talked about—it was all around them, making their race exciting and fun.
What is momentum, and how does it affect moving objects?

Why did Grumpy Bear's heavier car build up more momentum than Cheer Bear's lighter car?

If Cheer Bear's car was going fast at the start but slowed down due to friction, what would happen if there were no friction? Would she go slower, faster, or stay at the same speed?
