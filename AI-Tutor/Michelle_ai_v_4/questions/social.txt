@1. You are in the classroom and it’s break and you want to meet some new friends. You know Sarah likes Volleyball. What can you do to connect with her?

@2. You try to talk to someone about the Care Bears. That is a topic you really care about. They ignore you and blow you off. What should you do?

@3. You are at school today. You were playing tag with some other girls the day before at lunch. You try to play with them today and they tell you the game is full and you can't play with them. You are upset and hurt. You find yourself getting mad. You have resources like the counselor, self-control activities, and taking a break. The girl's name is Janet that you asked to play with. Navigate through this situation using the resources named and other resources to avoid a meltdown. #Lead her to getting help from the counselor

@4. You walk into the cafeteria and see a group of classmates sitting together and talking. They’re laughing and seem to be having a good time. You want to join them, but you’re not sure how. You stand nearby, unsure of whether to say something or wait for them to notice you. #To join the conversation, wait for a pause or natural break, then approach the group and say something like, "Hey, can I join you?" or ask a question about what they’re talking about. It’s important to show interest in their conversation before jumping in. Even if you feel nervous, using a friendly tone helps you get included naturally.

@5. In class, the teacher is explaining a math problem, and it starts to get confusing for you. Everyone around you seems to understand what’s going on, but you feel lost. You want to ask for help, but you’re afraid of standing out or interrupting the lesson. #It’s okay to ask for help! When you feel confused, raise your hand and say, "I’m sorry, I didn’t quite get that. Can you explain it again, please?" You can also wait until after class and approach the teacher privately. Asking for help shows that you’re taking your learning seriously, and your teacher will appreciate that.

@6. During recess, you overhear two classmates talking, and it sounds like they are saying something about you. You start to feel upset because you’re not sure if they are making fun of you or not. #It’s important not to jump to conclusions. You can calmly approach one of the classmates and say, "Hey, I overheard something, and I just wanted to make sure—were you talking about me?" This way, you give them a chance to explain, and it avoids any misunderstandings. If they were being hurtful, you can calmly tell them how it made you feel.

@7. You’re hanging out with a group of friends after school, and they suggest doing something you’re not comfortable with, like sneaking out to a place your parents don’t allow you to go. You feel nervous and don’t know how to say no without losing their friendship.
#It’s important to stand up for yourself, even when it feels hard. You can say something like, "I don’t feel comfortable doing that," or "I don’t want to get in trouble." True friends will respect your decision. If they keep pressuring you, it’s okay to walk away and let them know you can hang out another time.

@8. During gym class, one of your classmates makes a joke about your clothes in front of others. You feel embarrassed and don’t know what to say. The other kids are watching, waiting to see how you’ll react.
#Stay calm and confident. You can respond with, "I like what I’m wearing," and then change the subject or walk away. If the teasing continues, it’s okay to tell a teacher or trusted adult. The most important thing is to not let the teasing affect your self-esteem—you control how you feel, not others.

@9. There’s a new student in your class, and they don’t seem to know many people yet. You want to introduce yourself and make them feel welcome, but you’re not sure how to start the conversation without it feeling awkward. 
#Start with something simple! You can walk up to them and say, "Hi, I’m [your name]. I noticed you’re new here. How are you finding things so far?" You can also ask questions like, "Do you need help finding anything?" or "What classes do you like?" Starting with small, friendly questions helps break the ice and makes them feel included.

@10. You notice that your friend seems really upset during lunch. They’re not talking as much and are sitting by themselves. You want to help them feel better, but you’re not sure what to say.
#Approach them calmly and ask, "Hey, I noticed you seem a little down. Do you want to talk about it?" It’s important to show you care by listening without immediately trying to fix the problem. Sometimes, just being there and showing empathy is enough to make someone feel supported. If they don’t want to talk, you can say, "I’m here if you need me."
